# 🌆 Air Quality Monitoring with Machine Learning (Jakarta Case Study)

## 📘 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing air quality in Jakarta, one of the cities in Indonesia facing high pollution levels. The analysis emphasizes key pollutants such as PM10, SO₂, CO, and NO₂, which can seriously affect public health.

We utilized Python and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of predicting and monitoring air quality. The project also utilizes SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address imbalanced datasets and enhance model performance.



## 🧠 Objectives

* Analyze air quality data from Jakarta.
* Apply data preprocessing and visualization techniques.
* Implement machine learning models to predict air quality levels.
* Use SMOTE to balance imbalanced data and enhance accuracy.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
* Jupyter Notebook



## 📂 Files in This Repository

This repository contains all the necessary files for the project titled “Projek Machine Learning Fix”, which focuses on air quality analysis in Jakarta. The main notebook file, Projek Machine Learning Fix.ipynb, includes the data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation processes. The Dataset folder contains two CSV files, final_quality_air.csv and ispu_dki1.csv, which serve as the primary data sources used for the analysis and machine learning model development. Additionally, the requirements.txt file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project smoothly in any environment.
